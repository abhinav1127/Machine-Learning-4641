To run this, you must have Java Runtime Environment(JRE)1.4.2 or above.

To start the program, do these steps:
1. cd into the RL_sim directory.
2. Run this command 'java -jar rl_sim.jar'

The mazes I used for the project are the following:
Smaller MDP: 0_small.maze
Larger MDP: 6_medium_moderate.maze

Run Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, or Q-Learning:
1. Click the chosen category
2. Load the correct maze
3. Ensure PJOG is 0.3 and Precision is 0.001
4. If the category is Policy Iteration, ensure the value limit is 5000 and the Iter. Limit is 500.
5. If the category is Value or Policy Iteration, click Initialize and Execute. Examine your results.
5. If the category is Q-Learning, ensure the Epsilon is 0.1 and the Learning Rate is 0.7. Click Initialize and Step, Episode, and Cycle, as desired, and examine your results.
